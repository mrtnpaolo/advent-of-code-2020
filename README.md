# Advent of Code 2020

I enjoy working on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in Haskell and here you can find the product of this activity.

## Getting started

Install GHC 8.10.2 and cabal-install 3 via [`ghcup`](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/). Then in the root of the source directory:

```
$ cabal update
$ cabal build
```

To run a solution use: `$ cabal run Day01`.

## Videos

I have produced videos showing the process I went through in solving each of the problems:
